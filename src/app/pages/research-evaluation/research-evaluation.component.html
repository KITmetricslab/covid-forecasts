  <h3 class="display-3">Evaluation</h3>
    <p>
      We use two different measures to assess predictive performance.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The absolute error (AE) serves to assess the accuracy of the point forecast (typically the predictive median). </li>
      <li>The weighted interval score (WIS) assesses all prediction intervals (or quantiles) simulataneously and thus also takes into account the
      uncertainty of a distribution.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>
      For both measures lower values are better. An interactive app allowing you to explore the evaluation results for all models is available <a href="https://jobrac.shinyapps.io/app_evaluation/">here</a>.

    <h3 class="display-3">Research</h3>

    <p>The German and Polish COVID-19 Forecast Hub is embedded into a prospective forecast evaluation study. In October 2020 we deposited a study protocol
    laying out the exact procedures <a href="https://osf.io/cy937/registrations">here</a>. Results from the first evaluation period, which stretches from October to
    mid-December 2020, will be made available around the end of the year.
    We are closely collaborating with our colleagues from the <a href="https://covid19forecasthub.org">US COVID-19 Forecast Hub</a>. First results from this project (co-authored by members of our team)
    can be found here:
