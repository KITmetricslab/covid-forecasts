  <h3 class="display-3">About</h3>
  <p>
    The German and Polish COVID-19 ForecastHub aims to bring together short-term forecasts of the further course of the
    pandemic in Germany and Poland. Our goal is to systematically compare different predictions, identify particularly
    reliable models and assess whether combinations of different forecasts can yield more reliable results.
  </p>

  <p>
    The platform is run by members of the <a href="https://statistik.econ.kit.edu/index.php">Chair of Statistics and
      Econometrics</a> at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and the <a href="https://www.h-its.org/research/cst/">Computational Statistics
    Group</a> at Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies, with support from the
    <a href="https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/infections/epidemiology/signals/signals_node.html" target="_blank">Signale
      Team at Robert Koch Institut</a>. The project is developed in close
    exchange with the <a href="https://covid19forecasthub.org/doc/" target="_blank">US COVID-19 ForecastHub</a> run by
    the <a href="https://reichlab.io/" target="_blank">Reich Lab</a> at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project is public and all forecasts can be downloaded from our <a
      href="https://github.com/KITmetricslab/covid19-forecast-hub-de" target="_blank">github repository</a>. More ample
    information on this project can be found in
    the associated <a href="https://github.com/KITmetricslab/covid19-forecast-hub-de/wiki" target="_blank">Wiki</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The German and Polish COVID-19 Forecast Hub also forms the basis of a pre-registered forecast evaluation study on
    which we plan to report in 2021. The protocol is available <a href="https://osf.io/cy937/registrations" target="_blank">here</a>.
  </p>

  <h4 class="display-4">Forecast Targets</h4>

  <p>We currently focus on short-term forecasts of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19. Both targets are addressed
    both at an incident (i.e. weekly new cases and deaths) and a cumulative scale (total cases and deaths). New
    forecasts are issued every Monday/Tuesday and cover forecast horizons of one through four weeks into the future. A
    detailed description of forecast targets can be found <a
      href="https://github.com/KITmetricslab/covid19-forecast-hub-de/wiki/Forecast-targets" target="_blank">here</a>.

  <h4 class="display-4" id="datasources">Data Sources</h4>

  <p>Forecasts at the national level (both Poland and Germany) can refer to the two following data sources:</p>

  <p>Our visualization tool allows users to align the different forecasts with the different ground truths. For
    regional-level forecasts we use data from the following sources:</p>

  <h4 class="display-4">Get Involved</h4>
  <p>If you are working on forecasting of COVID-19 dynamics in Germany and/or Poland do not hesitate to get in touch
    with us.</p>

  <h4 class="display-4">Forecast Evaluation</h4>
  <p>
    One goal of this platform is to compare the forecast performance of different models systematically. Results will be
    included on this website shortly. An outline of the methods used for evaluation can be found in this <a
      href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12881" target="_blank">preprint</a>.
  </p>

  <h4 class="display-4">Ensemble Building</h4>
  <p>
    Each week we combine the different forecasts submitted to the platform into so-called ensemble forecasts. Such
    combined forecasts are known to yield more reliable predictions in many domains and are becoming increasingly used
    in epidemiology. See <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.20177493v1"
      target="_blank">here</a> for a recent preprint on
    ensemble forecasts based on the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Technical details are provided in <a
      href="https://github.com/KITmetricslab/covid19-forecast-hub-de/wiki/Creation-of-equally-weighted-ensemble"
      target="_blank">this wiki entry</a>.
