          Germany and Poland. There are also regional-level forecasts (German states or Polish voivodeships), but fewer
          teams make these available.

          can be shown on an incident (new cases or deaths) or cumulative (total cases or deaths) scale.

          select a time point by clicking in the forecast graph below. By clicking on the play button you can start an

          <b>Prediction interval</b> Forecasts always come with some uncertainty. Forecasters can therefore specify
          intervals which shall cover the true value with 50% or 95% probability. Note that not all forecasters make
          such intervals available.

          <b>Shift models to</b> Some modellers aim to forecast cases and deaths according to ECDC data, others
          according to data from Johns Hopkins University. For cumulative forecasts it can be helpful to align all
          forecasts with the same data to improve comparability. You can do this by selecting a truth data source here.
